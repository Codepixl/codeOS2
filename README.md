# codeOS2
### CodeOS Re-Written from scratch

### CODEOS2 MUST BE BOOTED FROM A HARD DRIVE, FLOPPY DRIVE, DVD DRIVE, OR CD DRIVE. THERE IS NO USB SUPPORT YET.

## How to use codeOS2

You can use the codeOS2.iso file in the bin folder. However, this file may not be up to date with the latest code changes.

Alternatively, you can set up your own GRUB disk (Grub 2 or higher) and use the KERNEL.SYS file in the bin folder along with the multiboot2 instruction.

## Goals

* Fat32 and Fat16 FS support
* Be able to run executables
* VGA Driver(?)
* User mode
* Shell and shell scripts
